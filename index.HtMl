        <p>Hey! I am Anushka Wasnik. Currently I am studying in 2nd year from electronics and telecommunication at Anjuman college of engineering and technology. My hobbies are dancing and sketching.

Currently, I am looking forward to a job in the IT field. I have done courses like C++ and Java.</p>
